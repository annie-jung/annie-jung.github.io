Hello, I am Yeongin Jung.   

I graduated from Pusan National University, College of Medicine.   

I am currently(2023) a graduate student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Master of Health Science Program(Health Economics and Outcomes Research).

I am interested in Medicine, Economic evaluation of Health care, and introducing new technology to the Medical field.

Besides academic matters, I love musicals(both seeing and performing), jogging, and hiking.
